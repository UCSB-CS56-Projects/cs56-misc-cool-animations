# cs56-misc-cool-animations
This repo is for W15 students with animations that might form future projects to enter issues letting us know

IF YOU THINK YOUR W15 lab05 animation could form the basis of a cool new legacy code project,
make an issue in this repo.   In the issue, put 

* a link to the final version of your public code, and the name of the subdirectory in which your animation lives. 
* a description of what you might add to it to make it a cool project. (e.g. for the clock, adding "alarms", time zones, etc. )
